# Things to do
- [x] Add a google maps shortcode type thing!
    * [x] [This theme](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme) has maps! Check out its contact page
    - [ ] Consider putting a map on both the landing page, and, like the [Universal theme](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme), on any page that has *id=map* in its frontmatter.
    - [ ] Create a CSS Box for the map to live in that's taller than 'box special'

    - [x] Single Page
          - [ ] CSS for the Audio player.
            - [ ] Make it the same height as the download button
            - [ ] Put both on the same line
    - [ ] List Page
      * [x] Left align text
      - [x] Right align 'feature image'
      - [x] Should the text be full width if there's no image?
      - [x] Fix the CSS so <ul class="pagination"> looks good!
    - [ ] Podcast RSS
- [ ] Make the screen/overlay of the background image darker or give it a pattern
