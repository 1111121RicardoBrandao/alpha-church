# Things to do
- [x] Break pages into partials
- [ ] Make index.html configurable via .toml
  - [x] Social/feed icons config
  - [x] Copyright notice
  - [x] Acknowledgements
- [x] Add a google maps shortcode type thing!
  - [x] [This theme](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme) has maps! Check out its contact page
  - [ ] Consider putting a map on both the landing page, and, like the [Universal theme](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme), on any page that has *id=map* in its frontmatter.
  - [ ] Create a CSS Box for the map to live in that's taller than 'box special'
- [x] User configurable multi-level menu. (https://gohugo.io/templates/menu-templates/)
- [x] Include Google Analytics
- [ ] Podcast page/content type
  - [x] Single Page
  - [ ] List Page
    - [x] Left align text
    - [x] Right align 'feature image'
    - [x] Should the text be full width if there's no image?
    - [ ] Fix the CSS so <ul class="pagination"> looks good! (Probably link it to class="copyright")
  - [ ] Podcast RSS
- [x] Find out how to pass through conditions in HTML comments. Ans: use `` to escape the string rather than "
- [ ] Make the screen/overlay of the background image darker or give it a pattern
- [x] ~~Markdownify the Site title (so you could have Alpha *Church*)~~ This didn't work easily.

## Version 2

* [ ] Break up home page (index.html) into widgets
